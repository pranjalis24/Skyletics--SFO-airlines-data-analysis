# Skyletics- SFO Airport analysis 

Issues being addressed: 
* Aircraft congestions- with limited runway and gate capacity, SFO tends to struggle to accomodate large no. of flights arriving and departing within a short timeframe. 
* Congestion- High passenger volumes can lead to congestion in terminal buildings, security checkpoints, and baggage claim areas. 
* Coordination of Airlines: Effective communication and coordination between airport and airlines to manage passenger flows and minimise delays. 

Solutions: 
* Predictive analytics: Using historical data to predict passenger volumes and flight delays, enabling better resource allocation and scheduling. 
* Communication platforms: Developing data driven communication systems to improve coordination between airport stakeholders.
* Infrastructure planning: Using data driven insights for long term infrastructure and capacity expansion. 
* Resource allocation: Optmising staffing and resources based on real time data, reducing operational      bottlenecks.
